<h2>Identifier</h2>
<p>
    In the previous parts of the course, the identification topic was briefly mentioned. The value object that is
    identified and differentiated by its value as described but what are other possibilities to differentiate between concepts?
</p>
<p>
    The domain concept not identified by its values is called <i>Entity</i> in DDD. Any entity represents more than just
    simple data container, it has its identity and must be identifiable somehow. Here comes the concept of the
    identifier.
</p>
<p>
    How can you identify a person? You might have guessed that with the given name and surname, but are you sure about
    that?
    People sometimes share given names and surnames. So governments around the world bestow multi-character codes upon
    every
    citizen to make the citizens distinguishable. It is sometimes your id card number or insurance number.
</p>
<p>
    The described above identifier is of artificial identifier type. The numbers are not directly connected with the
    entities,
    however, now they are distinguishable. They are typically generated by your software. Popular examples are UUIDs or
    sequential ids get from a database.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, natural identifiers also exist. A page in the book is identified by its unique number. Each day is
    identified by year, month and day in a month - a combination of all those attributes makes each day
    unique and identifiable. These kind of identifiers are typically provided externally, for example by user.

<h4>Notes about identifier</h4>
<ul>
    <li>One identifier for one entity. It cannot change overtime.</li>
    <li>It can be represented as a value object.</li>
    <li>It can be one or more values, as long as it ensures uniqueness of entity.</li>
</ul>
