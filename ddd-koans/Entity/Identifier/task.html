<h2>Identifier</h2>
<p>
    In the previous parts of the course, the identification topic was briefly mentioned. The value object that is
    identified by its value as described, however, the opposite situation was not presented.
</p>
<p>
    The domain concept not identified by its values is called <i>Entity</i> in DDD. Any entity represents more than just
    simple data container, it has its identity and must be identifiable somehow. Here comes the concept of the
    identifier.
</p>
<p>
    How can you identify a person? You might have guessed that with the given name and surname, but are you sure about
    that?
    People sometimes share given names and surnames. So governments around the world bestow multi-character codes upon
    every
    citizen to make the citizens distinguishable. It is sometimes your id card id number or insurance number.
</p>
<p>
    The described above identifier is of artificial identifier type. The numbers are not directly connected with the
    entities,
    however, now they are distinguishable. They are typically generated by your software. Popular examples are UUIDs or
    sequential ids get from a database.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, natural identifiers also exist. They are typically provided by an external provider, for example, a user.

<h4>Notes about identifier</h4>
<ul>
    <li>One identifier for one entity. It cannot change overtime.</li>
    <li>It can be represented as a value object.</li>
    <li>It can be one or more values, as long as it ensures uniqueness of entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>First domain entity</h2>
<p>
    It is time to introduce the first domain concept that should be modeled as an entity and not as a value object.
    <b>Bar</b>, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)">Wikipedia</a>, is
    <br>
    <br>
    <q>

        segment of time corresponding to a specific number of beats in which each beat is represented by a particular
        note value [...]. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a
        musical composition.
        <br>
        <br>
        Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length, [...] the number of beats in each bar
        is specified at the beginning of the score by the time signature
    </q>
    <br>
    <br>
    and now based on that you would implement the <code>Bar#id()</code> method for the Bar class. The only crucial
    information
    is that the bar identifier is defined in the context of a music piece/song, not globally as bars cannot exist
    outside the
    piece.
