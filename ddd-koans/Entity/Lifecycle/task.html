<h2>Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
    In the beginning, while creating a piece of music, bars don't exist in the piece at all.
    Then creators add bars one after another. They decide what time signature should
    be used and what notes should fill the bar.
</p>
<p>
    As the definition of the bar states, there is a limit on notes in the bar. So creators
    can add notes just to fill the limit. But, the bar is only complete when
    is filled with enough notes to match the beats corresponding to the bar's time signature.
</p>
<p>
    To recall information about time signature in a bar:
<ul>
    <li>The note value of the time signature defines which note value is equal to one beat.</li>
    <li>The number of beats declares how many beats makes a complete bar.</li>
</ul>
    Therefore, to create a complete bar, the sum of beats of note values in the bar must be equal
    to the time signature's number of beats.
</p>
<p>
    To sum up, a bar can not yet exist, be in an incomplete state or be in a complete state.
    The lifecycle must be modelled in the code then.
</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
    To begin with the lifecycle, please implement <code>Bar#state()</code> method which returns
    Bar.State.Complete for a complete bar, Bar.State.Incomplete for an incomplete bar and throws
    BarWithTooManyNotesException when there are too many notes in the bar.
</p>
<h2>Calculation examples</h2>
<h3>Incomplete</h3>
<!--TODO: Image with bar which is imcoplete and with calculations-->
<h3>Complete</h3>
<!--TODO: Image with bar which is complete and with calculations-->
<h3>Invalid</h3>
<!--TODO: Image with bar which is invalid and with calculations-->
