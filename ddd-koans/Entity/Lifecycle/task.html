        Hey, man! You must complete those bars in our piece you've just added. They are incomplete.
        Please put there your drum section! - said bassist.
    </q>
</p>
<p>
    <q>Uh, yeah, I will fill the missing notes - responded drummer.</q>
</p>
<h2>Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
    In the beginning, while creating a piece of music, bars don't exist in the piece at all.
    Then creators add bars one after another. They decide what time signature should
    be used and what notes should fill the bar.
</p>
<p>
    As the definition of the bar states, there is a limit on number of notes in the bar. So creators
    can add notes just to fill the limit. But, the bar is only complete when
    is filled with enough notes to match the beats corresponding to the bar's time signature.
</p>
<p>
    To recall information about time signature in a bar:
    <img alt="timeSignature" src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.musicnotes.com/now/wp-content/uploads/simple-time-signatures-44-e1550267258989.png">
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, to create a complete bar, the sum of beats of note values in the bar must be equal
    to the time signature's number of beats.
</p>
<p>
    To sum up, a bar can not yet exist, be in an incomplete state or be in a complete state.
    The lifecycle must be modelled in the code then.
</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
    To begin with the lifecycle, please implement <code>Bar.Companion#of()</code> factory method which returns
    expected instance of Bar (either CompleteBar or IncompleteBar) or throw BarWithTooManyNotesException if bar is
    invalid due to too big number of beats.
</p>
