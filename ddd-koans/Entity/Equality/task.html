<h2>Equality</h2>
<p>
    As has been already told, the entity has its unique identity based on the identifier. Therefore, two entities
    are the same if their identifiers are the same. For example, a person before and after changing the name
    is still the same person.
</p>
<p>
    In the previous task, the identifier of the <i>Bar</i> entity was found and now it is time to implement the
    <code>equal</code> method. Notes of the bar can change over time but the 46th bar of the piece of music will always
    be the 46th bar of the particular piece.
</p>
<p>
    Identity-based equality along with its unique identity is the property of the entity. This is opposite to the property-based
    equality and lack of identity of value objects. The state of the entity can change, however, identity stays the same.
    You will look into the matter closely in the upcoming tasks, however, for now just know that this reaches further than just using
    <code>var</code>s or <code>val</code>s in the implementation.
</p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
    We deliberately don't want to reuse <code>Any#equals</code> method as this allows comparison
    between incomparable objects. It does not make sense to compare TimeSignature with Bar, right?
