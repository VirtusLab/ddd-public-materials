    Let's play it once again starting from 44th bar - said drummer.

    All right - responded the band.

<h2>First domain entity</h2>
<p>
    It is time to introduce the first domain concept that should be modeled as an entity and not as a value object.
    <b>Bar</b>, based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(music)">Wikipedia</a>, is
    <br>
    <br>
    <q>

        segment of time corresponding to a specific number of beats in which each beat is represented by a particular
        note value [...]. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a
        musical composition.
        <br>
        <br>
        Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length, [...] the number of beats in each bar
        is specified at the beginning of the score by the time signature
    </q>
    <br>
    <br>
    and now based on that you would implement the <code>Bar#id()</code> method for the Bar class. The only crucial
    information
    is that the bar identifier is defined in the context of a music piece/song, not globally as bars cannot exist
    outside the piece of music.

    Dear Professor, how should I number a Bar if I would like to put it before the first one in the song? - said student.
</q>
<br/>
<q>
    Ha, the first Bar always has first number - 1- so you need to move other further and put your new bar at the beginning - explained Professor.
