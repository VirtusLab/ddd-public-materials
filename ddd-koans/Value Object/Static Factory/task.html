        You may have noticed that in Self Validation task we throw exception -> this behaviour breaks the flow. <br/>
        This is not the best thing to do so we would change the way we create TimeSignatures to be sure that exceptions are not thrown.

    <p>
        First of all, we are going to use a concept that origins in functional programming, but will
        help us in here. So, if you don't know <i>sealed classes</i> in Kotlin, read the
        <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html">documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can see in the code in the example we changed our TimeSignature class to ValidTimeSignatures and
        extend the newly created sealed class TimeSignature. We have also created object InvalidTimeSignature that also
        extends TimeSignature. Now you are going to implement <b>create</b> method that creates ValidTimeSignature or returns
        InvalidTimeSignature object.
    </p>

    <p>
        In text time signatures are written using the slash sign "/" like "3/4". <br/>
        It is an understandable notation for Musicians which can be easily followed in our model.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you think that musicians would understand such snippet <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")</i>? <br/>
        <hr>
        Hopefully, they do! <br/>

        Let's then implement such feature inside <b>TimeSignature</b> value object.
    </p>
    <p>
        You have to create <b>of</b> method that creates TimeSignature from String such as "1/2" or "4/4".
        The method call should look like this <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")</i> and in the given case create ValidTimeSignature(1,2).
        Please create the given method in such manner that it accepts just the minimal acceptable string representation of time signature,
        any additional whitespaces (like " 1/2", "4/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;") should return InvalidTimeSignature.
