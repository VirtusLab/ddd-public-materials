        You may have noticed that in Self Validation task we throw exception -> this behaviour breaks the flow. <br/>
        This is not the best thing to do so we would change the way we create TimeSignatures to be sure that exceptions are not thrown.

        First of all, we are going to use a concept that origins in functional programming, but will
        help us in here. So, if you don't know <i>sealed classes</i> in Kotlin, read the
        <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html">documentation</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you can see in the code in the example we changed our TimeSignature class to ValidTimeSignatures and
        extend the newly created sealed class TimeSignature. We have also created object InvalidTimeSignature that also
        extends TimeSignature. Now you are going to implement <b>create</b> method that creates ValidTimeSignature or returns
        InvalidTimeSignature object.
