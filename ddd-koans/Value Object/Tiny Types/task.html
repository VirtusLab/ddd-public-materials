    Please think about the time signature tasks you have finished so far. Could you imagine that by mistake you can add
    or subtract or do something else with both numerator and denominator? Would it be wise or bring any value?
    No, I would be just a mistake. However, you can find it out in runtime or hopefully using unit tests.
    Maybe we could use compiler to cover our mistake. But how?
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, such a mistake could be done because so far numerator and denominator were represented as
    Int values. We both know that numerator and denominator are not just typical Int values and Int as a type does
    not reflect to any concept from music domain. To know what is represented with the values we need to
    check properties' names. So we need a rescue here. The concept that will help us is called called <i>tiny types</i>.
</p>
<p>
    So <i>tiny type</i> is very small and simple value object with just one property. Typically it wraps primitive
    type. In this task you will have to find right names for two tiny types, add them as private property in
    ValidTimeSignature (maintaining immutability) and write <i>create</i> factory method again.
