    When musicians use <b>Time signature</b>, they don't think about putting any number as numerator or denominator.
    For them, numerator and denominator properties are pure concepts which are used to describe only a <b>Time signature</b>.
    <br/>
    Having that said, do you think that the current implementation of <b>Time signature</b> is also pure?
</p>

<p>
    Numerator and denominator are represented as Int values.
    We know that Numerator and Denominator are not just typical numeric values and Int as a type does not relate to the musical context.
    Ints can be i.e subtracted, but do Numerator and Denominator also?
    Could you imagine that by mistake you can add or subtract both numerator and denominator?
    Would it be wise or bring any value? No, I would be just a mistake.
    However, you can find it out in runtime or hopefully using unit tests.
    Maybe we could use a compiler to cover our mistake. But how?
</p>
<p>
    The concept that will help us is called <i>tiny types</i>.
    They are very small and simple value objects with just one property.
    Typically they wrap a primitive type.
</p>

<p>
    In this task you will have to find the right names for two tiny types, mark them with the keyword from the previous
    task (to make things faster and easier), add them as property in ValidTimeSignature (maintaining immutability)
    and write with the <i>create</i> factory method again.
</p>

<h3>Data class</h3>
<p>
    When you look at the previous tasks, you may have noticed that the task of creating a value object could
    be a repeatable task and generate boilerplate code. If you thought about it, you would not be the first person
    and thankfully in Kotlin (and some other languages), there is a way to cover some of the common properties
    of value objects with a very simple and basic approach.
</p>
<p>
    So to ensure immutability you have to use val keyword in case of properties and to provide equals method that
    covers equality based on data you could use data keyword right before keyword class in the class declaration.
    Using such data classes gives you some other features that are all covered in here:
    <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html">link</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To give you an opportunity to use the keyword use the keyword in the task.
