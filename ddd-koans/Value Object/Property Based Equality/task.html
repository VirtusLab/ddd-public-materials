<q>
    Hey, can we play one more note in the bar? - asks drummer
</q>
<br/>
<q>
    No, the tune is in 3/4 so only 3 beats of 1/4 notes in a bar could be played. I think, you thought about 4/4 time signature which different than 3/4 - answers pianist
</q>


<p>
    Please think about time signatures. How can one recognises a time signature? What make one time signature different from
    another? ðŸ¤”
</p>

<p>
    <b>Time signatures</b> can be recognised based on numerator and denominator. <br/>
    They are immutable so there is no way to change them after creation. <br/>
    Consequently, time signatures with at least one different value are not the same. <br/>
    Hopefully, you came to the same answers, didn't you?. <br/>
</p>

<p>
    As you can see time signatures lack identity. Musicians recognise them by their values. <br/>
    Lack of identity is key concept for understanding value objects,
    as they represent plain values from our domain.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the fact that value objects lack identity, there are compared just by the values/properties
    and in this task you will write equals method for TimeSignature.
