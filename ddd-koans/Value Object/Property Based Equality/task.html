<q>
    Hey, can we play one more note in the bar? - asks the drummer.
</q>
<br/>
<q>
    No, the tune is in 3/4 so only 3 beats of 1/4 notes in a bar could be played. I think you thought about a 4/4 time signature which is different from a 3/4 - answers pianist.
</q>


<p>
    Please think about time signatures. How can one recognise a time signature? What makes one time signature different from another?
</p>

<p>
    <b>Time signatures</b> can be recognised based on number of beats and denominator. <br/>
    They are immutable so there is no way to change them after creation. <br/>
    Consequently, time signatures with at least one different value are not the same. <br/>
    Hopefully, you came to the same answers, didn't you? <br/>
</p>

<p>
    As you can see time signatures lack identity. Musicians recognise them by their values. <br/>
    Lack of identity is a key concept for understanding value objects, as they represent plain values from our domain.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the fact that value objects lack identity, they are compared just by the values/properties and in this task
    you will write an equals method for TimeSignature.
