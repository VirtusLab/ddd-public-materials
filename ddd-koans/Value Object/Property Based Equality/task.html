    Please think about time signatures. How can one recognise time signature? What make one time signature different from
    another?
</p>

<p>
    I hope you came to the same answers as we the creators of the course. Time signatures can be recognised based on
    numerator and denominator. There is nothing that can change in them, time signatures with at least one different
    value are not the same.
</p>

<p>
    As you can see time signatures lack identity. There are not like a song, which you can change more or less
    but this can be still the same piece. Lacking of identity is key concept for understanding value objects,
    as they represent plain values not something we will call entity in next lessons that has its own identity.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the fact that value objects lack identity, there are compared just by the values/properties
    and in this task you will write equals method for TimeSignature.
