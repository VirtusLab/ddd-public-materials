<q>
    You cannot create music with an incorrect time signature like 1/17! You've just failed your exam - said the senior conductor.

    Oh, right, it was the reason why it sounded so odd - answers the music student.

<p>
    In text time signatures are written using the slash sign "/" like "3/4". <br/>
    It is an understandable notation for Musicians which can be easily followed in our model.
</p>
<p>
    Do you think that musicians would understand such a snippet <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")?</i><br/>
<hr>
Hopefully, they do!
</p>
<p> Let's then implement such a feature inside the <b>TimeSignature</b> value object. </p>
<p>
    You have to create a <b>of</b> method that creates TimeSignature from String such as "1/2" or "4/4".
    The method call should look like this <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")</i>. Please create the given method in such manner
    that it accepts just the minimal acceptable string representation of time signature,
    any additional whitespaces  (like " 1/2", "4/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;") or just wrong values should end up throwing
    an exception.
