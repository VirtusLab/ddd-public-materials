<q>
    Let's write a time signature of <b>1/2</b> at the beginning - says conductor.
</q>

<p>
    In text time signatures are written using the slash sign "/" like "3/4". <br/>
    It is an understandable notation for Musicians which can be easily followed in our model.
</p>
<p>
    Do you think that musicians would understand such snippet <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")</i>? <br/>
<hr>
Hopefully, they do! <br/>

Let's then implement such feature inside <b>TimeSignature</b> value object.
</p>
<p>
    You have to create <b>of</b> method that creates TimeSignature from String such as "1/2" or "4/4".
    The method call should look like this <i>TimeSignature.of("1/2")</i> and in the given case create
    ValidTimeSignature(1,2).
    Please create the given method in such manner that it accepts just the minimal acceptable string representation of
    time signature,
    any additional whitespaces (like " 1/2", "4/4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;") should return InvalidTimeSignature.
