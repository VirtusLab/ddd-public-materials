<h3>Immutability means that object's state cannot be changed after creation.</h3>
<p>
    In this task and at least few next you will develop TimeSignature class as it could serve as a great
    example of value object. So here we go with reminder of what they are.
</p>
<h4>
    Time signatures are symbols which
    describe repeating beat rhythm in a piece of music. It tells us the total length of all symbols in a bar.
    In text time signatures are written using the slash sign "/" like 3/4. The upper value is called numerator and
    lower denominator.
</h4>
<p>
<div>
    As the description states TimeSignature must contain only two properties:
    <ul>
        <li>nominator,</li>
        <li>denominator,</li>
    </ul>
    both of them should be of type <b>Int</b> and declared using <b>val</b> not
    <del>var</del>.
</div>
<br>
<div>
    Doing it that way will ensure immutability of thr TimeSignature.
</div>
</p>
<div class="hint">
    Remember not to use nullable type <b>Int?</b>.
</div>
