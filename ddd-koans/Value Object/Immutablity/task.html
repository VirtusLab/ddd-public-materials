    Let's play it in 3/4 - says vocalist.

<q>
  It's such a vibrant time signature, let's do it - answers guitarist.

    In this task and at least few next you will develop a <b>TimeSignature</b> class. <br/>
    It could serve as a great example of a <b>value object</b>. <br/>
    So here we go with a reminder of what time signatures are:
</p>
<h4>
    Time signatures are symbols which describe repeating beat rhythm in a piece of music. <br/>
    It tells us the total length of all symbols in a bar. <br/>
    The upper value is called numerator and lower denominator.
    <br/>
    <br/>

</h4>
<p>
<div>
    As the description states <b>TimeSignature</b> must contain only two properties:
    <ul>
        <li>numerator,</li>
        <li>denominator,</li>
    </ul>
    Both properties should be of type <b>Int</b>.
</div>
<br>

<h4>
    Immutability is a one of characteristics of <b>Value Object</b>. <br/>
    It means that once <b>value object</b> is created, it can never be changed. So the state is unchangeable.
</h4>

<br/>

<div>
   Implement a <b>TimeSignature</b> class that will ensure immutability.
</div>
</p>
<div class="hint">
    <div>Both properties should be declared using <b>val</b> not
        <del>var</del>
        .
    </div>
    <div>Remember not to use nullable type <b>Int?</b>.</div>
</div>
