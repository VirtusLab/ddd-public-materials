        Remember that TimeSignature must contain only two properties:
        <ul>
            <li>nominator,</li>
            <li>denominator,</li>
        </ul>
        both of them should be of type <b>Int</b> and declared using <b>val</b> not <del>var</del>.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Doing it that way will ensure immutability of thr TimeSignature.
    </div>

    <div class="hint">
        Remember not to use nullable type <b>Int?</b>.
    </div>
