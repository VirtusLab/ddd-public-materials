<q>
    Let's play it in 3/4 - says the vocalist.

<q>
    It's such a vibrant time signature, let's do it - answers the guitarist.

<p>
    In this task and at least for the next few you will develop a <b>TimeSignature</b> class. <br/>
    It could serve as a great example of a <b>value object</b>. <br/>
    So here we go with a reminder of what time signatures are:
</p>
<h4>
    Time signatures are symbols which describe repeating beat rhythm in a piece of music. <br/>
    It tells us the total length of all symbols in a bar. <br/>
    The upper value is called a numerator and the lower value is a denominator.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img src="https://github.com/VirtusLab/ddd-public-materials/blob/master/ddd-koans/Value%20Object/Immutablity/3over4.png?raw=true">
</h4>
<p>
<div>
    As the description states <b>TimeSignature</b> must contain only two properties:
    <ul>
        <li>numerator,</li>
        <li>denominator,</li>
    </ul>
    Both properties should be of type <b>Int</b>.
</div>
<br>

<h4>
    Immutability is one of the characteristics of a <b>Value Object</b>. <br/>
    It means that once a <b>value object</b> is created, it can never be changed. So the state is unchangeable.
</h4>

<br/>

<div>
   Implement the <b>TimeSignature</b> class in a way that will ensure immutability.
</div>
</p>
<div class="hint">
    <div>Both properties should be declared using <b>val</b> not
        <del>var</del>
        .
    </div>
    <div>Remember not to use nullable type <b>Int?</b>.</div>
</div>
