<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    Let’s go through the traits and concepts that are connected to Value Object and you have already learned about so far.
<ul>
    <li>
        A value object is immutable. It <b>must not</b> have any state other than initial, therefore
        its methods cannot alter its state. However, it is still possible for methods to return new
        instances of the value object.
    </li>
    <li>
        Value objects should be self-validating. It should be impossible to create a value object with invalid
        values. There should be no chance that an invalid value object is present in the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Value objects should be compared using their properties. They do not have an identity.
        A value object is distinguishable from others just by its properties.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a static factory to create your value object with a cleaner and more concise code.
        You could also use the approach to prevent throwing an exception on invalid data.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember, a value object and its name, properties, methods reflect domain representation of that concept.
        You create code not only for you but also for other people, including domain experts.
        That would probably make their life easier.
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating tiny types to represent very simple value objects can prevent mistakes in compile time.
    </li>
</ul>
The above list is a mandatory starting point. Let’s continue to learn even more!
