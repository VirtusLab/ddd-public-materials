    <b>TimeSignature</b> is described using two properties, the same you have declared in previous task. <br/>
    However, values of this properties cannot be random integers. There are <b>domain rules</b>.
    If you don't remember, here you go:
    <ul>
        <li>numerator is a number between 1 and 32,</li>
        <li>denominator is a number between 1 and 32,</li>
        <li>denominator is a number of power of two.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <div>How should we validate the values? Let your code throw an exception of any kind on invalid values</div>
    <div>Consider using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/require.html">require function</a>.</div>
</p>

<p>
    To check if number is power of two we provided extension functions <b>Int.main.isPowerOfTwo()</b>.
</p>

<div class="hint">
    This may not be obvious at first glance, but if you correctly check if denominator is power of two, then checking
    if denominator is between 1 and 63 would make test pass as values between 32 and 63 are covered by the power of two
    condition.
