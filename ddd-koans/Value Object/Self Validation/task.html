    Have you ever heard about 3/5 time signatures? - asks the bassist.
</q>
<br/>
<q>
    No, it sounds weird and incorrect - answers the drummer.
</q>
<q>
    What about 200 over 4? - asks the bassist.
</q>
<br/>
<q>
    Nah, sounds crazy and could be expressed even with 32nds - answers the drummer

    <b>TimeSignature</b> is described using two properties, the same you have declared in the previous task. <br/>
    However, values of these properties cannot be random integers. There are <b>domain rules</b>.
    If you don't remember, here you go:
    <ul>
        <li>number of beats is a number between 1 and 32,</li>
        <li>note value is a number between 1 and 32,</li>
        <li>note value is a power of two.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <div>How should we validate the values? Let your code throw an exception of any kind on invalid values.</div>
    <div>Consider using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/require.html">require function</a>.</div>
</p>

<p>
    To check if the number is a power of two we provided extension function <b>Int.main.isPowerOfTwo()</b>.
</p>

<div class="hint">
    This may not be obvious at first glance, but if you correctly check if note value is in a power of two,
    then checking if note value is between 1 and 63 would make the test pass as values between 32 and 63 are
    covered by the power of two conditions.
