    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Let’s go through the traits and concepts that are connected to Value Object and you have already learned about so far.
        <ul>
            <li>
                A value object is immutable. It <b>must not</b> have any state other than initial, therefore its methods
                cannot alter its state. However, it is still possible for methods to return new instances of
                the value object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Value objects should be self-validating. It should be impossible to create a value object with invalid
                values. There should be no chance that an invalid value object is present in the system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Value objects differ from each other only by properties as they don't have identities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a static factory to create your value object with a cleaner and more concise code. You could also
                use the approach to prevent throwing an exception on invalid data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remember, a value object's name, properties, methods reflect domain representation of that concept.
                You create code not only for you but also for other people, including domain experts. That would probably make their life easier.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The above list is a mandatory starting point. Let’s continue to learn even more!
    </p>
    <h3>Data class</h3>
    <p>
        When you look at the previous six tasks, you may have noticed that the task of creating a value object could
        be a repeatable task and generate boilerplate code. If you thought about it, you would not be the first person
        and thankfully in Kotlin (and some other languages), there is a way to cover some of the common properties of
        value objects with a very simple approach.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure immutability you had to use <i>val</i> keyword and provide equals based on properties.
        Therefore use the val keyword on properties to ensure immutability and make it a data class (see example on the left) using <i>data</i> keyword.
        Using such data classes gives you some other features that are all covered
        in here: <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html">link</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To give you an opportunity to use the keyword small task was prepared at the end of this part of course.
        It would cover one extra concept connected with the Domain-Driven Design and Value Objects. Please also,
        take a look at how TimeSignature is implemented using <i>data class</i> in this task or the next one.
