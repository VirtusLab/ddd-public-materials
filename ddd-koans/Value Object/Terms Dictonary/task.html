<h2>Domain terms</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Time signature</b> - Symbols that describe repeating beat rhythm in a piece of music.
            It consists of the number of beats and the note value.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Number of beats</b> -
            The upper number of time signature indicates how many beats constitute a bar.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Note value</b> -
            The lower number of time signature always corresponds to the beat unit which is a value of a music note.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Bar</b> -
            A written up piece of music is divided into chunks called bars.
            Each bar follows a time signature assigned at the beginning of the bar until a new time signature occurs.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Note</b> -
            Symbol is denoting a musical sound. Notes can represent the pitch and duration of a sound in musical notation.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h2>Domain-driven design </h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li> <b>Value object</b> -
            domain-driven design building block, an immutable type that is defined by its state properties.
            The value object should be also self-validating.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Immutability</b> -
            property of the object or data structure that prevents its state changes after its creation
        </li>
        <li> <b>Property-based equality</b> -
            equality based only on the values of the object without using any reference to the object's identity.
        </li>
        <li> <b>Tiny type</b> -
            Type typically with one property, that is just wrapper around other non-domain value. Representing
            such non-domain value as a simple <i>value object</i> prevents lots of errors and ensures that all of
            the objects has domain meaning. Example class: NumberOfBeats, NoteValue.
        </li>
    </ul>
