<h3>Oops...</h3>
<p>
    In the previous task, one thing was added without much explanation or consideration. You may
    have thought about it or not, it does not matter as the concept is going to be introduced now.
</p>
<h3>Combinable property</h3>
<p>
    The <code>operator fun plus(other: Length): Length</code> was added, this is not that trivial
    as it seems. In the case of length, it is very natural to add one to another, however, it is worth
    considering how you can combine other value objects. This doesn't have to be adding, it can be
    any way to bind or bond values together.
</p>
<p>
    The possibility to combine value objects is called <i>Combinable</i> property. It is connected
    with behavior-rich property, as being combinable extends the behavior of the value object.

<h3>Your task</h3>
<p>
    The Notes class now is enriched with some method definition but is lacking implementation. Please
    fill in the <code>Notes.plus(...)</code> methods to make the Notes (value object) combinable.
    It seems to be quite natural to just add one note or notes to other notes container and it will
    be used in further tasks.
</p>
<p>
    PS. Adding note or notes to notes is not commutative!
