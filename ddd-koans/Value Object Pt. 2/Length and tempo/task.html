    Let's play this tune a little bit faster - says conductor.
</q>
<br>
<q>
    Like what? - asks drummer
</q>
<br>
<q>
    10 BPM more.
</q>
<br>
<q>
    Ok, so it gonna be 130BPM!

<h3>How to measure the real length of note value</h3>
<p>
    As was stated in the introduction, the note value represents length in abstract unit of beats.
    Therefore, to get to know the real length in time, the beats must be translated to time unit and
    the beat must be connected to corresponding note value.
</p>
<p>
    In case of the beat matching the note value, the default assumption is
    1 beat is equal to length of quarter note value and this will be only mapping in the course. So remember
    <b>1 beat = length of quarter note value</b>. However it is possible
    to use eight note value or half note value as equal to one beat.
</p>
<p>
    In music the concept of this translation is called <i>tempo</i>. It represents number of beats in the minute.
    The class was already implemented for you, please take a look. The 'bpm' is well known and widely used shortcut for
    beats per minutes.
</p>
<h4>Example how to calculate length:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Note value: eighth note value
    </li>
    <li>
        Tempo: 30 bpm
    </li>
    <li>
        Target time unit: seconds
    </li>
</ul>
Steps:
<p>
<ol>
    <li>
        As 1 beat equals value of quarter note value and eighth note value lasts half of quarter note value, then eighth
    note value has value equal to 0.5 as <q><i>1 beat(s) / 2 = 0.5 beats</i></q>.
    </li>
    <li>
        As tempo is <q><i>30 beats/minute</i></q>, then to obtain the value in minutes, we need to divide,
        the eight note value in beats by the tempo value.<br>
        <q><i>0.5 beats / (30 beats/minute) = (1/60) minute</i></q>
    </li>
    <li>
        To obtain the time value in given unit, we must change the unit from minutes to seconds.
        As we all know, one minute is 60 seconds.
        Therefore:
        <q><i>(1/60) minute * 60 (seconds/minute) = 1 s</i></q>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Now we can provide the answer, the length on eighth note value in tempo 30 bpm is 1 second.
</p>
<h3>What to do?</h3>
<p>
    As you can see the Tempo class is already implemented and it is very simple tiny type, that is validated to be in
    between 0 and 400 exclusive. However,
    the most popular tempos are 60 bpm (1 beat per second) and 120 bpm (2 beats per second).
</p>

<p>
    As you can notice, the LengthInTempo interface was added and NoteValue does implement it, but there is no
    implementation
    provided. Your task is to provide the implementation.
</p>

<p>
    As you can see, the only method of the interface does return
    yet another value object called Length that has one property: <code>val durationInSeconds: BigDecimal</code>.
    Please make your solution return result accurate at least to the second decimal place measured in seconds.
</p>

<p>
    If you have trouble achieving it that please read <a
        href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html">
    the documentation of BigDecimal class</a>.
