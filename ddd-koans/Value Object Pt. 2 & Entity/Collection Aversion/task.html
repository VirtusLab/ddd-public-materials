<h3>Value of a note</h3>
<p>
    It may seem that one single note is quite a big thing. It has its value and pitch. It represents something.
    However, when you play music, that is not enough. Music needs lots of notes to sound together or one after another.
</p>
<h3>How to collect notes?</h3>
<p>
    So, there is a need to collect notes in one container. Kotlin has special types for groups of objects i.e.
    collection,
    list, set, however, do the types relates anyhow to the domain? No, they don't. Additionally, does a group of
    notes need any method like <a
    href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/binary-search.html"><code>binarySearch</code></a>
    or <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/flat-map.html"><code>flatMap</code></a>?
    Of course not!
</p>
<h3>Collection aversion to the rescue</h3>
<p>
    To remove direct usage of collections in our domain code and to create an only simple interface for a group of
    notes, we need wrapper type. The original Kotlin collection would be wrapped in a new type with a new
    interface only with behaviours that are sensible considering the music domain.
</p>
<p>
    Such an approach is called collection aversion, there is no need for typically available in standard library
    collections, so we use them from behind the wrapper types and as little as needed.
</p>
<p>
    There are three main reasons to do that and you can see them in the above text:
<ul>
    <li>Collections with their names and behaviours are not part of the domain so we should not pollute domain model
        with them.
    </li>
    <li>Interfaces of collection types are rather rich in behaviour, most of which is not necessary from the domain's
        perspective. The wrapper type ensures smaller and more domain specific interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        In case of Kotlin and some other languages, collections are created with a type parameter, when we create a wrapper
        type it is just for one type and there is no problem with generics at all.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Time for code!</h3>
<p>
    As you could have noticed, our container for notes is called just Notes. As these are just notes, no more no less.
    The Notes class is just wrapper of <code>List&lt;Note&gt;</code> and as note can have its length, the notes also
    can have length and this is your task to implemented the method to do it.
</p>
<p>
    PS. To make your task easier we implemented <code>operator fun plus(other: Length)</code> in Length class, so
    you can add Lengths directly.
