    As you can see, the NoteValue value object encapsulates quite complicated
    computation of the length in tempo. The Length value object isn't connected
    to nor NoteValue or Tempo and is plain value, it is not part of the state of
    any of the value objects.

<p>
    Thanks to returning just the value, without changing
    any state (which is impossible in case of value object!) makes the code
    easy to test and does prevent need to make any assertions of any object state.

    People sometimes argue, if value object can have behavior or should be just plain data containers.
    The answer is simple yes they can, as long as, the properties of value object are not broken to provide the
    behavior.

    Additionally, yet very important, we can see cooperation of two value object to obtain
    the third one. This is so-called rich-behaviour as stated in <a href="">Martin Fowler's blog</a>:
</p>
<q><i>
    I find that value objects, particularly small ones, are often overlooked - seen as too trivial to be worth thinking about. But once I've spotted a good set of value objects, I find I can create a rich behavior over them.
</i></q>
<p>
    Rich-behavior is considered to be yet another property or value object. If there is a single value object or
    some cooperation of value objects, if it fits the domain, the value objects should have rich behavior. They don't
    have to be just immutable data containers.
