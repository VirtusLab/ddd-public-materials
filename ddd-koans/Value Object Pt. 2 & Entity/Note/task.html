<h3>Theory</h3>
<p>
    This is finally the time when the <b>note</b> is introduced. So far you have learned about note value, however,
    how can we transform note values into notes?
</p>
<p>
    As it was mentioned in the <i>Introduction</i> task: "The thing (note value's shape) becomes a note only when
    written on the stave (the five parallel lines)". So, what is the purpose of the stave?
</p>
<p>
    The stave represents a different musical pitch and the pitch is an element that combined with note values creates
    a note. So the question has to be asked again. What is the pitch?
</p>
<p>
    By English <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)">Wikipedia</a>:
    <br>
    <br>
    <q>
        Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale, or
        more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in
        the sense associated with musical melodies.
    </q>
    <br>
    <br>
    And additionally to present the relationship between pitch and frequency:
    <br>
    <br>
    <q>
        Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific
        attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's subjective perception of a sound wave, which cannot be
        directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are
        higher
        and lower.
    </q>
</p>
<h3>Time to code</h3>
<p>
    Pitch is implemented as enum class (as there is a finite number of pitches in music)
    and has been provided for you. NoteValue has been already implemented by you.
    <br>
    <br>
    The note implementation has also been provided as this is a simple value object with two properties,
    however, it uses a quite nice feature of Kotlin language called implementation by delegation <a
    href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegation.html#implementation-by-delegation">(link)</a>.
    As you can guess, <code> : LengthInTempo by noteValue</code> means that the Note implements LengthInTempo
    interface, however it delegates calls to interface method to its property noteValue as it does implement the same
    interface.
    <br>
    <br>
    Some methods were added to the mentioned classes to make it easier to obtain Note class and some of them
    needs implementation and here comes you.
</p>
<p>
    PS. We moved the Tempo and Length connected stuff to different file.
</p>
<p>
    PS2. Pitch is represented in text same as enum instances are named.
