<h3>Feeling a little bit lost</h3>
<p>After the first lesson about value object you can feel a little bit lost, if not that's good for you :)</p>
<p>
    It's hard to simultaneously explain Kotlin, domain-driven design and music, but now, we have hope that basics of
    value objects are not so scary anymore. Therefore, in the next few task, we will focus on the music.
</p>
<p>
    In the first part of the <i>Value Object Pt. 2 & Entity</i> lesson you will use the value objects
    (both known and unknown yet). They will be used to introduce the concepts from the music domain. After, the
    first part, the new domain-driven design concept, the <b>Entity</b> will be explained and used by you.
</p>

<h3>Time signature and it's note value</h3>
<p>
    In the previous lesson, the note value was just the part of the time signature and represented internally
    (thanks to the <b>tiny object</b>) as simple integer value.
</p>
<p>
    However, note value is a bigger concept and it is used also in the note concept itself. The note value
    represents relative duration of the note in abstract/relative unit of beats.
</p>
<p>
    As there is also concept of duration in music,
    we will use word <i>length</i> for the real time the note value represents. To calculate the length, you will also need concept that
    represents how long the beat as a unit lasts. And this is what you are going to do in the next task.
</p>
<p>
    What's the most interesting, the note value's graphical representation is well-known to all of us. Please take
    a look at the below table. This round something, with or without stems and flags is the note value. The thing becomes
    a note only when written on the stave (the five parallel lines). As long as there is no stave, there is just a
    plain note value.
</p>
<table style="text-align: center">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Note value symbol</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Written in text as</th>
        <th>Relative value</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/whole-note.png" alt="whole-note"></td>
        <td>whole note</td>
        <td><strong>1/1</strong></td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/half-note.png" alt="half-note"></td>
        <td>half note</td>
        <td><strong>1/2</strong></td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/quarter-note.png" alt="quarter-note"></td>
        <td>quarter note</td>
        <td><strong>1/4</strong></td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/eight-note.png" alt="eight-note"></td>
        <td>eighth note</td>
        <td><strong>1/8</strong></td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/16th-note.png" alt="sixteenth-note"></td>
        <td>sixteenth note</td>
        <td><strong>1/16</strong></td>
        <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="images/32th-note.png" alt="thirtysecond-note"></td>
        <td>thirty second note</td>
        <td><strong>1/32</strong></td>
        <td>32</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
    There are more note values than that, but we will use just these six for the sake of simplicity.
