<h1>EduTools plugin</h1>
<h3>Plugin</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/education/educational-products.html">Jetbrain's Educational Products</a> are
    set of tools that can be used for teaching and learning programming in form of various different tasks.
    <br><br>
    The EduTools plugin is required to start course. </br>
    Thanks to that plugin, many courses can be browsed and run in the Intellij IDE itself.
    <br><br>
</p>

<h3>Working with the course</h3>
<p>
    There are three main parts of the Intellij's window that you will interact with:
<ul>
    <li>Course structure on the left</li>
    <li>Code editor in the middle</li>
    <li>Task description on the right</li>
</ul>

<br>
Each will be described separately in next tasks in the <i>EduTools and basics</i> lesson.
<br><br>
Don't worry about lessons and task now, if you want to learn about them just press <i>Next</i> button.
You can also write any code in the middle and then press run to make it work.
