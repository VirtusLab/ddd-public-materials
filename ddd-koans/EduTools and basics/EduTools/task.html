    There are three main parts of the Intellij's window that you will interact with:
<ul>
    <li>Course structure on the left</li>
    <li>Code editor in the middle</li>
    <li>Task description on the right</li>
</ul>

Additionally, on the bottom of the right sidebar with the task description, there are two button
<i>Run</i> and <i>Next</i> as you can in the below picture.

Please click on the <i>Next</i> button to go to the next task or <i>Run</i> to execute code available
in the code editor.
<br>
<br>
Each will be described separately in next tasks in the <i>EduTools and basics</i> lesson.
<br><br>
Don't worry about lessons and task now, if you want to learn about them just press <i>Next</i> button.
You can also write any code in the middle and then press run to make it work.
